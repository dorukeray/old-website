      <h2>Story</h2>
      <div class="image-set undraw">
        <img src="./images/openbook.svg" alt="An Open Book">
        <p>My Story - begins in 2004</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Just a kid? Wait!</h3>
      <p>I was so curious that my mom had to teach me how to read and write when I was <strong>3</strong>. This was the
        start in my life. I loved tinkering with things, to understand how they work and how to build them. <strong>I've
          always been dreaming to be an inventor since then.</strong></p>
      <p>When I started elementary school, I spent my whole time with <strong>reading about history and drawing the
          moments, battle scenes, maps which I just read.</strong> This was exciting until I realized that how tables
        can turn so quickly. Today I may be victorious, glorious; but tomorrow maybe defeated, perished.</p>
      <h3>New beginnings...</h3>
      <p>I started programming when I was <strong>10</strong>, and this was a milestone in my journey. You write the
        code, and let everyone use it. What you can do is only limited by your skills and your imagination. My secondary
        school years were spent on personal projects.</p>
      <p>After a boring exam year, I entered <strong>Vefa Lisesi</strong>, a historical high school in Istanbul. Then I
        discovered <strong>the Web</strong>, and started writing for it. Incredible. There also I met Berk, who is a
        fellow of <a href="https://dorkodu.com">Dorkodu</a>.</p>
      <h3>Dorkodu: Revolutions</h3>
      <p>Dorkodu was born when I first branded all my work under the name of "Dorkodu", I was in secondary school then.
        The name comes from <strong>"Doruk" + "code"</strong>.</p>
      <p>When I saw the truth behind the Web, I asked this question myself : <strong>Do we really get the pure and true
          information from Web? No. All we get is some pages that others created.</strong> There is no chance to get
        what/how exactly you want.</p>
      <p>What if we had a <strong>universal knowledge resource</strong> that we can find, discover and exchange only the
        true, meaningful and useful information? The search results would be pure information pieces connected to each
        other, gathered from the whole accumilation of open human knowledge.</p>
      <p>This is what I dedicated the first part of my career to.</p>
      <p>You can see <a href="https://dorkodu.com">Dorkodu</a> to learn more about our projects.</p>
